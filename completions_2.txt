 Based on the given information, we can calculate the final amount of popcorn James has left after the popcorn is popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking.

The first 30 seconds of cooking resulted in 20 popcorns popping.

The next 30 seconds resulted in 5 times the rate of the first 30 seconds, which is \(5 \times 20 = 100\) popcorns popping.

Number of boxes of muffin sold on Wednesday = Number of boxes of muffin sold on Tuesday + 24 boxes of blueberry pie

Since John sold 14 fewer boxes of blueberry pie than on Tuesday, we'll use the formula for the difference in the number of boxes:

Number of boxes of muffin sold on Wednesday = Number of boxes of muffin sold on Tuesday + 24

The care facility has a total of 3000 wards, and 1/5 of them are occupied. Therefore, the number of occupied wards is 3000 * 1/5 = 600.
The total number of wards that are not occupied is therefore 3000 - 600 = 2400.

In 3 weeks, there will be 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.
After 3 weeks, the number of unoccupied wards will be 2400 - (21 * 40) = 2400 - 840 = 15

The care facility has a capacity of 3000 wards and 1/5 of them are occupied. So, the number of occupied wards is 3000 * 1/5 = 600 wards.
The total number of patients admitted into the care facility each day is 40. Over 3 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is 40 * 3 * 7 = 840 patients.
To find the number of unoccupied wards, we subtract the number of patients admitted from the total number of patients admitted. So, the number of unoccupied wards

The number of boys playing volleyball is 21, and the number of girls playing volleyball is also 21, so the total number of boys and girls playing volleyball is 21+21 = 42.
The total number of students playing any group is the sum of the students playing badminton, football, and volleyball, so 8 + 16 + 42 = 66.
