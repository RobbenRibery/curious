1. The popcorn started popping at a rate of 100 in the first 18 seconds.
2. In the next 18 seconds, 5 times the rate of the first 18 seconds increased to 5 * 100 = 500 pop.
3. In the final 18 seconds, the popcorn increased to 6 times the rate of the first 18 seconds, so it was 6 * 100 = 600 pop.

 To find out how many pieces of popcorn Michael has to eat, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of popcorns popped in the first 18 seconds: 100 popcorns * 18 seconds = 1800 popcorns
2. Calculate the total number of popcorns popped in the next 18 seconds: 5 times the initial rate of 18 seconds = 5 * 1800 popcorns = 9000 popcorns

The initial number of kernels that popped is 100.
In the first 18 seconds, the number of kernels that popped is 100 * 1 = 100.
In the next 18 seconds, the number of kernels that popped is 100 * 5 = 500.
In the final 18 seconds, the number of kernels that popped is 500 / 2 = 250.

 The reasoning process and answer are:

As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. In the first 18 seconds, 100 pop. In the next 18 seconds, 5 times the amount of the first 18 seconds pop. So, in the next 18 seconds, 5 * 100 = 500 pop.

In the final 18 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 18 seconds. So, in the final 18 seconds, 500 / 2 = 250 pop

 To calculate the number of people infected after 3 days, we can use the formula: 

Number of people infected = Initial number of people * Number of people infected each day * Number of days

Given:
- Initial number of people = 8
- Number of people infected each day = 6
- Number of days = 3

Let's calculate the result:

Number of people infected = 8 * 6 * 3

Now, let's do the calculation:

Number of people infected = 8 * 6 * 3 = 144

So, after 3 days, a total of

 <think> reasoning process: The number of people infected each day is the number of people infected initially plus the number of people infected after each day. After 3 days, the total number of people infected is the initial number of people infected plus the number of people infected after each day. This is given in the question. </think>

 To determine the number of people infected after 3 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Number of people infected on the first day**: Since there are 8 people and each person infects 6 others, the total number of people infected on the first day is \(8 \times 6 = 48\).

2. **Number of people infected on the second day**: Since each person infects 6 others, the number of people infected on the second day is \(48 \times 6 = 288\).

3. **Number of people infected on the third day**: Since each person

 To find the total number of people infected after 3 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people infected each day: Each infected person infects 6 others each day.
2. Multiply the number of infected people each day by the number of days: 8 * 6 * 3 = 144 people.

Therefore, after 3 days, a total of 144 people are infected.
