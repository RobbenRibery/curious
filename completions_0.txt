 To calculate the total cost of everything, we first need to determine the cost of the expensive brand of tea and then add it to the cost of the normal brand. 

The normal brand of tea costs €15 per kg. The more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand. This means the more expensive brand costs:

\[ 15 \text{ €/kg} \times 1.40 = 21 \text{ €/kg} \]

 To calculate the total cost of the tea and muffin, we need to first determine the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Then, we add the cost of the tea and the muffin together, and subtract the cost of the tea and the muffin from the total cost to get the final cost.

The more expensive brand of tea costs 40% more than the normal brand. So, the cost of the more expensive brand of tea is:

 <think> The normal brand of tea costs €15 per kg. He buys a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out.

He uses 3 kg of tea per day, so he uses 3 * 7 = 21 kg of tea in a week. He decides to buy himself a muffin for €4.
******** completion 29 *********
 To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tea and the muffin, and then add them together. The cost of the tea is the normal price per kg multiplied by the number of kg he buys. The cost of the muffin is the price per kg multiplied by the number of kg he uses per day. Finally, we add these two amounts to get the total cost.

He uses 3 kg of tea per day for 7 days, so he uses 3 * 7 = 21 kg of tea in a week.
The cost of the tea is 21 * €15 = €315 per week.

Let's assume the number of apartments in the last complex is \(x\).

The first 5 apartment complexes have 150 apartments each, and the last one is 80% bigger than the first 5 combined. So, the last complex has 150 + (150 * 0.8) = 150 + 120 = 270 apartments.
Robert collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes, so he collects garbage 6 times a week.
He gets paid €0.45 per collection for each apartment, so he makes 6 * €0.45 = €2.7 per week.

 To calculate the total time Sophia spent playing these games, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent on the jigsaw puzzles: 25 minutes per puzzle x 2 puzzles = 50 minutes
2. Calculate the total time spent on the brain teasers: 18 minutes per puzzle x 15 puzzles = 270 minutes

Now, add the time spent on the jigsaw puzzles and the brain teasers to find the total time Sophia spent playing these games:

50 minutes (jigsaw puzzles) + 270 minutes (brain teasers) = 320

 To find out how much time Sophia spent playing these games, we can break down the time she spent solving puzzles and brain teasers into their respective totals and then add them together. Here's how:

1. Solve 2 jigsaw puzzles: Sophia solved 2 puzzles, so the total time spent on jigsaw puzzles is 2 * 25 minutes = 50 minutes.

2. Solve 15 brain teasers: Sophia solved 15 brain teasers, so the total time spent on brain teasers is 15 * 18 minutes = 270 minutes.
