Let's start by calculating how many red cards are there.
<think>
20% more than blue cards is calculated as follows:
blue cards = 50
red cards = blue cards + 20% of blue cards
red cards = 50 + (20/100)*50
red cards = 50 + 10
red cards = 60

Now, let's calculate how many yellow cards there are.
<think>
yellow cards = sum of blue and red cards
yellow cards = 50 + 60
yellow cards = 1

 <think> there are 50 blue cards, 20% more red cards than blue cards, and yellow cards as many as the sum of blue and red cards. </think>
******** completion 9 *********
 <think>
The total number of cards in the set is 50 blue + 20% more red cards + yellow cards. 
20% of 50 is 5, so the total number of red cards is 50 + 5 = 55.
The number of yellow cards is the sum of blue and red cards, so it is 50 + 55 = 105.
Therefore, there are 50 blue, 55 red, and 105 yellow cards in the set. The answer is 105.

3. He needs 150 days to eat 150 eggs.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs David eats over the 150 days. Since he eats 4 eggs a day for 72 days and then increases it to 6 eggs a day for 78 days, he eats a total of \(72 \times 4 + 78
******** completion 101 *********
 <think> David eats 4 eggs a day for 72 days. This means he eats 4 * 72 = 288 eggs in those 72 days. He then increases it to 6 eggs a day for 78 days, so he eats 6 * 78 = 468 eggs in those 78 days. So, in total, David eats 288 + 468 = 756 eggs over the 150 days. To find out how many dozens of eggs David needs for 150 days, we divide the total

 <think>David ate 4 eggs per day for 72 days and then increased it to 6 eggs per day for 78 days. The total number of eggs David ate over 150 days is (4 x 150) + (6 x 150). The number of dozens of eggs David will need is 150 / 12. </think>

 To find out how many dozens of eggs David will need for 150 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs David will consume over the course of these two periods.

For the first period:
- David eats 4 eggs a day for 72 days.
- So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first period is \(4 \times 72 = 288\) eggs.

For the second period:
- David eats 6 eggs a day for 78 days.
- So, the total number of eggs he eats in the second period is \(6 \times 7

 <think> David eats 4 eggs a day for 72 days, so he eats 4 * 72 = 288 eggs in total. He then increases it to 6 eggs a day for 78 days, so he eats 6 * 78 = 486 eggs in total. So, the total number of eggs he eats in 150 days is 288 + 486 = 774 eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs David needs is 774 / 12 =
******** completion 105 *********
 <think>
4 eggs/day * 72 days = 288 eggs consumed
6 eggs/day * 78 days = 468 eggs consumed
Total consumed = 288 + 468 = 756 eggs
150 days * 12 eggs/dozen = 1800 eggs
<think>
Therefore, David will need 1800 dozens of eggs for 150 days.

 <think> David eats 4 eggs a day for 72 days, so he eats 4 x 72 = 288 eggs in total. He then increases it to 6 eggs a day for 78 days, so he eats 6 x 78 = 468 eggs in total. So in total, David eats 288 + 468 = 756 eggs in 150 days. 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, so 756 / 12 = 63 dozens of eggs will be needed for 15

 To calculate the total number of eggs David will need for 150 days, we first need to determine the total number of eggs David will eat over the course of 150 days.

For the first 72 days, he eats 4 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs eaten over these 72 days is:
\[ 72 \times 4 = 288 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 78 days, he eats 6 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs eaten over these 78 days is:
\[ 78

 To find out how many dozens of eggs David will need for 150 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he will consume over the specified period and then divide that number by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen).

Let's start by calculating the total number of eggs David will consume over the 72 days he eats 4 eggs per day.

For the first 72 days:
- Daily consumption: 4 eggs/day
- Total days: 72 days

Total eggs consumed = 4 eggs/day * 72 days = 288 eggs

 To calculate the total number of dozens of eggs David needs for 150 days, we first need to determine the total number of eggs he eats over the 72 days he starts eating 4 eggs a day and the 78 days he starts eating 6 eggs a day.

- For the first 72 days, he eats 4 eggs a day.
- For the next 78 days, he eats 6 eggs a day.

The total number of eggs he eats over the 150 days is the sum of the eggs he eats each day for these two periods.
