Answer:
James delivers 10 x 20 = <<10*20=200>>200 bags a day.
So, he can deliver 200 x 5 = <<200*5=1000>>1000 bags in 5 days.
#### 1000
Completion:
To calculate how many bags James delivers in 5 days, we first need to determine the total number of bags he delivers in a single day. 

Given that he can carry 10 bags on each trip and takes 20 trips a day, we can calculate the total number of bags he delivers in a day as follows:

Total bags per day = 10 bags/trip * 20 trips/day = 200 bags/day

Now, to find out how many bags he delivers in 5 days, we multiply the daily number of bags by 5:

Total bags in 5 days = 200 bags/day * 5 days = 1000 bags

So, James delivers 1000 bags in 5 days.

So, he can deliver 200 x 5 = <<200*5=1000>>1000 bags in 5 days.
#### 1000
Completion:
To calculate how many bags James delivers in 5 days, we first need to determine the total number of bags he delivers per day, and then multiply that by 5 days.

1. **Calculate the number of bags per day**: James can carry 10 bags on each trip, and he takes 20 trips a day.

2. **Calculate the total number of bags delivered in a day**: Multiply the number of bags per day by the number of trips per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of bags delivered in 5 days**: Multiply the number of bags delivered per day by 5.

Let's calculate this:

- Number of bags per day = 10 bags/trip * 20 trips/day = 200 bags/day
- Total bags delivered in 5 days = 200 bags/day * 5 days = 1000 bags

So, James delivers 1,000 bags in 5 days.

He can carry 10 bags on each trip, and he takes 20 trips a day.
\[ \text{Number of bags delivered in one day} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

2. Calculate the total number of bags delivered in 5 days:
\[ \text{Total bags delivered in 5 days} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, James delivers 1000 bags in 5 days.

Question:
James hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?
Answer:
The injury would be fully healed after 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 days
So he would start exercising again in 15+3=<<15+3=18>>18 days
He would then wait for 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 more days to start lifting heavy again
That means he needs to wait 18+21=<<18+21=39>>39 days
#### 39
Completion:
<think> 3 days after the injury, the pain subsided, so the injury would take 5 * 3 days = 15 days to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.

<think> The injury took 5 times longer than 3 days to fully heal, so it would have taken 3 x 5 = 15 days to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again, so he would have waited 15 + 3 = 18 days before starting to lift heavy again. If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, he would have waited 3 x 7 = 21 days before that. So, until he can lift heavy again, he would have waited 21 + 3 = 24 days. </think>

Question:
James hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?
Answer:
The injury would be fully healed after 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 days
So he would start exercising again in 15+3=<<15+3=18>>18 days
He would then wait for 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 more days to start lifting heavy again
That means he needs to wait 18+21=<<18+21=39>>39 days
#### 39
Completion:
<think> James hurt himself exercising for 3 days and the pain subsided after 3 days. This means he had a total of 3 days of injury. James knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal, which means it would take 5 * 3 = 15 days to heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again. So in total, he would have waited 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 days for his injury to fully heal. If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, which is equal to 3 * 7 = 21 days, then in total, he would have waited 9 + 21 = 30 days. Therefore, until he can lift heavy again, he would have waited 30 days. </think>

#### 10
Completion:
To calculate the profit on each orange, we first need to find out the total cost of the oranges and the total revenue from selling them.

Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. So, the cost per orange is $12.50 / 25 = $0.50.

He sells each orange for 60 cents. So, the revenue per orange is 60 cents / 25 = 2.4 cents.

To find the profit per orange, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

Profit per orange = Revenue per orange - Cost per orange
Profit per orange = 2.4 cents - 0.50 cents
Profit per orange = 1.9 cents

So, Joshua will make a profit of 19 cents on each orange.

$1 is equivalent to 100 cents so $12.50 is equivalent to 100*12.50 = <<12.50*100=1250>>1250 cents
He bought 25 oranges for 1250 cents so each orange cost 1250/25 = <<1250/25=50>>50 cents each
If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60-50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cents on each one.
#### 10
Completion:
To find the profit per orange, we first need to calculate the cost price per orange, and then subtract the selling price from the cost price to find the profit. The cost price per orange is the total amount spent on the oranges divided by the number of oranges, while the selling price per orange is the total amount spent on the oranges plus the profit.

Let's start by calculating the cost price per orange:

1. Cost price per orange = Total amount spent on the oranges / Number of oranges
2. Cost price per orange = $12.50 / 25
3. Cost price per orange = $0.50

Next, we calculate the profit per orange:

1. Profit per orange = Selling price per orange - Cost price per orange
2. Profit per orange = $60 - $0.50
3. Profit per orange = $59.50

To convert this profit to cents, we multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):

1. Profit in cents = $59.50 * 100
2. Profit in cents = $5950

Therefore, Joshua will make a profit of 5950 cents on each orange.

#### 10
Completion:
To calculate the profit on each orange, we need to first determine the cost price of each orange, which is the total cost of the oranges minus the revenue from selling the oranges.

The total cost of the oranges is the cost per orange multiplied by the number of oranges:
Cost per orange = $12.50 / 25 oranges = $0.50/orange

The revenue from selling each orange is the selling price per orange multiplied by the number of oranges:
Revenue per orange = $0.60/orange

To find the profit on each orange, we subtract the cost price from the revenue:
Profit per orange = Revenue per orange - Cost per orange

We can calculate the profit per orange using the formula:
Profit per orange = $0.60 - $0.50 = $0.10

To convert this profit to cents, we multiply by 100:
Profit per orange in cents = $0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

So, Joshua will make a profit of 10 cents on each orange.

Question:
Jason and Jeremy want to paint their wall white and agreed to split the cost of the paint. A gallon of paint costs $45 and can cover up to 400 square feet. How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?
Answer:
They need 1600 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<1600/400=4>>4 gallons of paint for their walls.
Since they will do a second coating, then they would need 4 gallons x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 gallons in all.
Eight gallons of paint will cost $45/gallon x 8 gallons = $<<45*8=360>>360.
Thus, Jason and Jeremy will each contribute $360/2 = $<<360/2=180>>180.

1. Calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted.
2. Calculate the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the paint.
4. Divide the total cost by the number of gallons to find out how much each person will contribute.

Let's start with these steps:

1. Calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted.
2. Calculate the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the paint.
4. Divide the total cost by the number of gallons to find out how much each person will contribute.

First, let's calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted:

Total square footage = Total area of walls * Number of coats
Total square footage = 1600 square feet * 2
Total square footage = 3200 square feet

Now, let's calculate the number of gallons needed:

Number of gallons = Total square footage / Coverage of one gallon
Number of gallons = 3200 square feet / 400 square feet
Number of gallons = 8 gallons

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the paint:

Total cost of paint = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost of paint = 8 gallons * $45 per gallon
Total cost of paint = $360

Finally, let's divide the total cost by the number of gallons to find out how much each person will contribute:

Cost per person = Total cost of paint / Number of gallons
Cost per person = $360 / 8 gallons
Cost per person = $45

So, each person will contribute $45 to the cost of the paint.

Question:
Jason and Jeremy want to paint their wall white and agreed to split the cost of the paint. A gallon of paint costs $45 and can cover up to 400 square feet. How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?
Answer:
They need 1600 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<1600/400=4>>4 gallons of paint for their walls.
Since they will do a second coating, then they would need 4 gallons x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 gallons in all.
Eight gallons of paint will cost $45/gallon x 8 gallons = $<<45*8=360>>360.
Thus, Jason and Jeremy will each contribute $360/2 = $<<360/2=180>>180.

How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?
Answer:
They need 1600 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<1600/400=4>>4 gallons of paint for their walls.
Since they will do a second coating, then they would need 4 gallons x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 gallons in all.
Eight gallons of paint will cost $45/gallon x 8 gallons = $<<45*8=360>>360.
Thus, Jason and Jeremy will each contribute $360/2 = $<<360/2=180>>180.

Let's calculate the total cost of the paint for both Jason and Jeremy.

1. First, we need to determine the total area of their walls. Since the total area of the walls is 1600 square feet and they need a second coat, the area of one wall is 1600/2 = 800 square feet.

2. Now, we can calculate the number of gallons needed for the entire wall. Since the paint covers 400 square feet per gallon and they will need 800 square feet for both walls, they will need 800/400 = 2 gallons of paint.

3. Next, we calculate the cost of the paint for both Jason and Jeremy. The cost of one gallon of paint is $45, so for 2 gallons, it would be 2 * $45 = $90.

4. Finally, we can calculate how much each of them will contribute to the cost of the paint. Jason will contribute $90, and Jeremy will contribute $90/2 = $45.

The answer is: Jason, $90, Jeremy, $45.

Question:
If 100 pieces, each 15 centimeters long, are cut from a 51-meter long ribbon, how much ribbon remains ?
Answer:
The total length cut from the 51-meter ribbon is 100 x 15 centimeters = <<100*15=1500>>1500 centimeters.
Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, then 1500 centimeters is equal to 1500/100 = <<1500/100=15>>15 meters.
Therefore, 51 - 15 = <<51-15=36>>36 meters of ribbon remains.
#### 36
Completion:
<think> The total length of the ribbon is 51 meters. Each piece is 15 centimeters long, which means each piece is 0.15 meters long. If 100 pieces are cut, then the total length of the pieces is 100 * 0.15 = 15 meters. Therefore, the remaining length of the ribbon is 51 - 15 = 36 meters. </think>

Completion:
<think> 51 meters of ribbon was cut, and 100 pieces each 15 centimeters long, making a total of 100*15=1500 centimeters of ribbon. 1500 centimeters of ribbon is 51 meters long, so the remaining ribbon is 51-1500= -4990 meters long. Since a meter is not a whole number, we need to round this down to the nearest whole number, which is 4990 meters. So, there is 4990 meters of ribbon remaining. </think>

Answer:
The total length cut from the 51-meter ribbon is 100 x 15 centimeters = <<100*15=1500>>1500 centimeters.
Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, then 1500 centimeters is equal to 1500/100 = <<1500/100=15>>15 meters.
Therefore, 51 - 15 = <<51-15=36>>36 meters of ribbon remains.
#### 36
Completion:
<think> Reasoning process here: The total length of the ribbon is 51 meters, and each piece is 15 centimeters long. To find out how many pieces can be cut from the 51-meter long ribbon, we divide the total length by the length of each piece. So, 51 meters / 15 centimeters = 3.4 meters. Since we can't cut a piece in half, we'll have to cut 4 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 4 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 60 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 60 centimeters = 45 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 9 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 5 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 5 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters.

Completion:
<think> Reasoning process: Timmy needs to go 40 mph at the start to make it all the way to the top of the ramp. He has three trial runs and averaged 36 + 34 + 38 = 108 mph. To make it up the ramp, he needs to go 40 - 108 = -68 mph faster. However, since speed is always a positive number, we need to find the absolute difference between the average speed and the required speed. The absolute difference is |-68| = 68 mph. Therefore, Timmy needs to go 68 mph faster than his average speed to make it up the ramp. </think>

Question:
The space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.   The three cylindrical structures are linked together by a series of tunnels that hold them together and allow the crew to move between cylinders.  Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?
Answer:
If there are 3 identical cylindrical structures, with a combined total of 72 rooms, then each individual cylindrical structure contains 72/3=<<72/3=24>>24 rooms.
In each 24-room cylindrical structure, there are 24-12-7=<<24-12-7=5>>5 kitchens.
Thus, the entire, three-cylinder space station contains a total of 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 kitchens.
#### 15
Completion:
To find out how many kitchens there are on the entire space station, we need to subtract the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens from the total number of rooms. Let's do the math:

- The number of bedrooms is 12 rooms.
- The number of bathrooms is 7 rooms.
- The number of kitchens is 72 rooms - 12 rooms - 7 rooms.

Now, let's calculate the number of kitchens:

- Number of kitchens = Total rooms - (Number of bedrooms + Number of bathrooms + Number of kitchens)
- Number of kitchens = 72 - (12 + 7 + 7)

Let's do the math:

- Number of kitchens = 72 - (19 + 7)
- Number of kitchens = 72 - 26
- Number of kitchens = 46

So, there are 46 kitchens on the entire space station.

Question:
The space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.   The three cylindrical structures are linked together by a series of tunnels that hold them together and allow the crew to move between cylinders.  Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?
Answer:
If there are 3 identical cylindrical structures, with a combined total of 72 rooms, then each individual cylindrical structure contains 72/3=<<72/3=24>>24 rooms.
In each 24-room cylindrical structure, there are 24-12-7=<<24-12-7=5>>5 kitchens.
Thus, the entire, three-cylinder space station contains a total of 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 kitchens.

Answer:
James delivers 10 x 20 = <<10*20=200>>200 bags a day.
So, he can deliver 200 x 5 = <<200*5=1000>>1000 bags in 5 days.
#### 1000
Completion:
To calculate how many bags James delivers in 5 days, we first need to determine the total number of bags he delivers in a single day. 

Given that he can carry 10 bags on each trip and takes 20 trips a day, we can calculate the total number of bags he delivers in a day as follows:

Total bags per day = 10 bags/trip * 20 trips/day = 200 bags/day

Now, to find out how many bags he delivers in 5 days, we multiply the daily number of bags by 5:

Total bags in 5 days = 200 bags/day * 5 days = 1000 bags

So, James delivers 1000 bags in 5 days.

#### 1000
Completion:
To calculate how many bags James delivers in 5 days, we first need to determine the total number of bags he delivers per day, and then multiply that by 5 days.

1. **Calculate the number of bags per day**: James can carry 10 bags on each trip, and he takes 20 trips a day.

2. **Calculate the total number of bags delivered in a day**: Multiply the number of bags per day by the number of trips per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of bags delivered in 5 days**: Multiply the number of bags delivered per day by 5.

Let's calculate this:

- Number of bags per day = 10 bags/trip * 20 trips/day = 200 bags/day
- Total bags delivered in 5 days = 200 bags/day * 5 days = 1000 bags

So, James delivers 1,000 bags in 5 days.

James hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?
Answer:

<think> The injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal, so it would take 3 x 5 = 15 days to fully heal. After that, James wants to wait another 3 days before he starts working out again, so the total time until he can start lifting heavy again is 15 + 3 = 18 days. If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, that would be 3 x 7 = 21 days. So in total, James will have to wait 21 + 18 = 39 days until he can lift heavy again. </think>

Question:
James hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?
Answer:
The injury would be fully healed after 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 days
So he would start exercising again in 15+3=<<15+3=18>>18 days
He would then wait for 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 more days to start lifting heavy again
That means he needs to wait 18+21=<<18+21=39>>39 days
#### 39
Completion:
<think>
James' injury would take at least 3 * 5 = 15 days to fully heal.
After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again. So, in total, he would wait 15 + 3 = 18 days.
He wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.
To find out how long until he can lift heavy again, we add the 18 days he has already been waiting to the 21 days he wants to wait. So, the total time until he can lift heavy again is 18 + 21 = 39 days.
The answer is: 39

If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60-50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cents on each one.
#### 10
Completion:
To calculate the profit on each orange, we first need to find out the total cost of the oranges and the total revenue from selling them.

Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. So, the cost per orange is $12.50 / 25 = $0.50.

He sells each orange for 60 cents. So, the revenue per orange is 60 cents / 25 = 2.4 cents.

To find the profit per orange, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

Profit per orange = Revenue per orange - Cost per orange
Profit per orange = 2.4 cents - 0.50 cents
Profit per orange = 1.9 cents

So, Joshua will make a profit of 19 cents on each orange.

If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60-50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cents on each one.
#### 10
Completion:
To find the profit per orange, we first need to calculate the cost price per orange, and then subtract the selling price from the cost price to find the profit. The cost price per orange is the total amount spent on the oranges divided by the number of oranges, while the selling price per orange is the total amount spent on the oranges plus the profit.

Let's start by calculating the cost price per orange:

1. Cost price per orange = Total amount spent on the oranges / Number of oranges
2. Cost price per orange = $12.50 / 25
3. Cost price per orange = $0.50

Next, we calculate the profit per orange:

1. Profit per orange = Selling price per orange - Cost price per orange
2. Profit per orange = $60 - $0.50
3. Profit per orange = $59.50

To convert this profit to cents, we multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):

1. Profit in cents = $59.50 * 100
2. Profit in cents = $5950

Therefore, Joshua will make a profit of 5950 cents on each orange.

If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60-50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cents on each one.
#### 10
Completion:
To calculate the profit on each orange, we need to first determine the cost price of each orange, which is the total cost of the oranges minus the revenue from selling the oranges.

The total cost of the oranges is the cost per orange multiplied by the number of oranges:
Cost per orange = $12.50 / 25 oranges = $0.50/orange

The revenue from selling each orange is the selling price per orange multiplied by the number of oranges:
Revenue per orange = $0.60/orange

To find the profit on each orange, we subtract the cost price from the revenue:
Profit per orange = Revenue per orange - Cost per orange

We can calculate the profit per orange using the formula:
Profit per orange = $0.60 - $0.50 = $0.10

To convert this profit to cents, we multiply by 100:
Profit per orange in cents = $0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

So, Joshua will make a profit of 10 cents on each orange.

Question:
Jason and Jeremy want to paint their wall white and agreed to split the cost of the paint. A gallon of paint costs $45 and can cover up to 400 square feet. How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?
Answer:
They need 1600 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<1600/400=4>>4 gallons of paint for their walls.
Since they will do a second coating, then they would need 4 gallons x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 gallons in all.
Eight gallons of paint will cost $45/gallon x 8 gallons = $<<45*8=360>>360.
Thus, Jason and Jeremy will each contribute $360/2 = $<<360/2=180>>180.
#### 180
Completion:
<think>
The total area of their walls is 1600 square feet, and they will need a second coat. So, they need to cover a total of 1600 x 2 = 3200 square feet.
A gallon of paint can cover up to 400 square feet, so they will need 3200 / 400 = 8 gallons of paint.
Each gallon of paint costs $45, so the total cost of the paint will be 8 x $45 = $360.
Each of them will contribute $360 / 2 = $180 to the cost of the paint.
The answer is: $180.

Question:
Jason and Jeremy want to paint their wall white and agreed to split the cost of the paint. A gallon of paint costs $45 and can cover up to 400 square feet. How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?
Answer:
They need 1600 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<1600/400=4>>4 gallons of paint for their walls.
Since they will do a second coating, then they would need 4 gallons x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 gallons in all.
Eight gallons of paint will cost $45/gallon x 8 gallons = $<<45*8=360>>360.
Thus, Jason and Jeremy will each contribute $360/2 = $<<360/2=180>>180.
#### 180
Completion:
<think>
The wall has a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat, so the total area to be painted is 1600 * 2 = 3200 square feet.
A gallon of paint covers 400 square feet, so they need 3200 / 400 = 8 gallons of paint.
A gallon of paint costs $45, so the total cost of the paint is 8 * $45 = $360.
Each of them will contribute $360 / 2 = $180 to the cost of the paint.
The answer is: $180

To calculate how much each person will contribute to the cost of the paint, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted.
2. Calculate the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the paint.
4. Divide the total cost by the number of gallons to find out how much each person will contribute.

Let's start with these steps:

1. Calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted.
2. Calculate the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the paint.
4. Divide the total cost by the number of gallons to find out how much each person will contribute.

First, let's calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted:

Total square footage = Total area of walls * Number of coats
Total square footage = 1600 square feet * 2
Total square footage = 3200 square feet

Now, let's calculate the number of gallons needed:

Number of gallons = Total square footage / Coverage of one gallon
Number of gallons = 3200 square feet / 400 square feet
Number of gallons = 8 gallons

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the paint:

Total cost of paint = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost of paint = 8 gallons * $45 per gallon
Total cost of paint = $360

Finally, let's divide the total cost by the number of gallons to find out how much each person will contribute:

Cost per person = Total cost of paint / Number of gallons
Cost per person = $360 / 8 gallons
Cost per person = $45

So, each person will contribute $45 to the cost of the paint.

Question:
Jason and Jeremy want to paint their wall white and agreed to split the cost of the paint. A gallon of paint costs $45 and can cover up to 400 square feet. How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?
Answer:
They need 1600 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<1600/400=4>>4 gallons of paint for their walls.
Since they will do a second coating, then they would need 4 gallons x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 gallons in all.
Eight gallons of paint will cost $45/gallon x 8 gallons = $<<45*8=360>>360.
Thus, Jason and Jeremy will each contribute $360/2 = $<<360/2=180>>180.
#### 180
Completion:
<think> A gallon of paint costs $45 and can cover up to 400 square feet. So, the cost of one gallon of paint is $45 * 400 = $1800. 
Their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat. So, the total area that needs to be painted is 1600 * 2 = 3200 square feet. 
Since a gallon of paint can cover up to 400 square feet, they will need 3200 / 400 = 8 gallons of paint. 
Therefore, the total cost of the paint is $45 * 8 = $360. 
Each of them will contribute $360 / 2 = $180 to the cost of the paint. </think>

Let's calculate the total cost of the paint for both Jason and Jeremy.

1. First, we need to determine the total area of their walls. Since the total area of the walls is 1600 square feet and they need a second coat, the area of one wall is 1600/2 = 800 square feet.

2. Now, we can calculate the number of gallons needed for the entire wall. Since the paint covers 400 square feet per gallon and they will need 800 square feet for both walls, they will need 800/400 = 2 gallons of paint.

3. Next, we calculate the cost of the paint for both Jason and Jeremy. The cost of one gallon of paint is $45, so for 2 gallons, it would be 2 * $45 = $90.

4. Finally, we can calculate how much each of them will contribute to the cost of the paint. Jason will contribute $90, and Jeremy will contribute $90/2 = $45.

The answer is: Jason, $90, Jeremy, $45.

Question:
If 100 pieces, each 15 centimeters long, are cut from a 51-meter long ribbon, how much ribbon remains ?
Answer:
The total length cut from the 51-meter ribbon is 100 x 15 centimeters = <<100*15=1500>>1500 centimeters.
Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, then 1500 centimeters is equal to 1500/100 = <<1500/100=15>>15 meters.
Therefore, 51 - 15 = <<51-15=36>>36 meters of ribbon remains.

Answer:
The total length cut from the 51-meter ribbon is 100 x 15 centimeters = <<100*15=1500>>1500 centimeters.
Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, then 1500 centimeters is equal to 1500/100 = <<1500/100=15>>15 meters.
Therefore, 51 - 15 = <<51-15=36>>36 meters of ribbon remains.
#### 36
Completion:
<think> Reasoning process here: The total length of the ribbon is 51 meters, and each piece is 15 centimeters long. To find out how many pieces can be cut from the 51-meter long ribbon, we divide the total length by the length of each piece. So, 51 meters / 15 centimeters = 3.4 meters. Since we can't cut a piece in half, we'll have to cut 4 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 4 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 60 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 60 centimeters = 45 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 9 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 5 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 5 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters.

Question:
A bottle of wine costs $20.00 today.  When new tariffs are imposed in 2 months, the price of wine will increase by 25%.  How much more expensive will 5 bottles of wine be in 2 months?
Answer:
Today, 5 bottles of $20.00 wine will cost 5*20 = $<<5*20=100.00>>100.00
In 2 months there will be a 25% tariff on the 5 bottles of wine that cost $100.00 so that makes the 5 bottles .25*100 = $25.00 more expensive

Question:
Timmy plans to ride a skateboard ramp that is 50 feet high. He knows he needs to go 40 mph at the start to make it all the way to the top. He measures his speed on three trial runs and goes 36, 34, and 38 mph. How much faster does he have to go than his average speed to make it up the ramp?
Answer:
His total speed from the trials is 108 because 36 + 34 + 38 = <<36+34+38=108>>108
His average speed was 36 mph because 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36

<think> Reasoning process: Timmy needs to go 40 mph at the start to make it all the way to the top of the ramp. He has three trial runs and averaged 36 + 34 + 38 = 108 mph. To make it up the ramp, he needs to go 40 - 108 = -68 mph faster. However, since speed is always a positive number, we need to find the absolute difference between the average speed and the required speed. The absolute difference is |-68| = 68 mph. Therefore, Timmy needs to go 68 mph faster than his average speed to make it up the ramp. </think>

Question:
The space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.   The three cylindrical structures are linked together by a series of tunnels that hold them together and allow the crew to move between cylinders.  Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?
Answer:
If there are 3 identical cylindrical structures, with a combined total of 72 rooms, then each individual cylindrical structure contains 72/3=<<72/3=24>>24 rooms.
In each 24-room cylindrical structure, there are 24-12-7=<<24-12-7=5>>5 kitchens.
Thus, the entire, three-cylinder space station contains a total of 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 kitchens.
#### 15
Completion:
To find out how many kitchens there are on the entire space station, we need to subtract the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens from the total number of rooms. Let's do the math:

- The number of bedrooms is 12 rooms.
- The number of bathrooms is 7 rooms.
- The number of kitchens is 72 rooms - 12 rooms - 7 rooms.

Now, let's calculate the number of kitchens:

- Number of kitchens = Total rooms - (Number of bedrooms + Number of bathrooms + Number of kitchens)
- Number of kitchens = 72 - (12 + 7 + 7)

Let's do the math:

- Number of kitchens = 72 - (19 + 7)
- Number of kitchens = 72 - 26
- Number of kitchens = 46

So, there are 46 kitchens on the entire space station.

Question:
The space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.   The three cylindrical structures are linked together by a series of tunnels that hold them together and allow the crew to move between cylinders.  Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?
Answer:
If there are 3 identical cylindrical structures, with a combined total of 72 rooms, then each individual cylindrical structure contains 72/3=<<72/3=24>>24 rooms.
In each 24-room cylindrical structure, there are 24-12-7=<<24-12-7=5>>5 kitchens.
Thus, the entire, three-cylinder space station contains a total of 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 kitchens.
#### 15
Completion:
To find the number of kitchens on the entire space station, we can first determine the total number of bedrooms and bathrooms in the space station, and then subtract that from the total number of rooms to get the number of kitchens.

Total number of bedrooms and bathrooms = 12 bedrooms + 7 bathrooms = 19 rooms
Total number of rooms = 72 rooms

Number of kitchens = Total number of rooms - Total number of bedrooms and bathrooms = 72 rooms - 19 rooms = 53 kitchens
The number of kitchens on the entire space station is 53.

Completion:
To calculate how many bags James delivers in 5 days, we first need to determine the total number of bags he delivers in a single day. 

Given that he can carry 10 bags on each trip and takes 20 trips a day, we can calculate the total number of bags he delivers in a day as follows:

Total bags per day = 10 bags/trip * 20 trips/day = 200 bags/day

Now, to find out how many bags he delivers in 5 days, we multiply the daily number of bags by 5:

Total bags in 5 days = 200 bags/day * 5 days = 1000 bags

So, James delivers 1000 bags in 5 days.

Question:
James hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?
Answer:
The injury would be fully healed after 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 days
So he would start exercising again in 15+3=<<15+3=18>>18 days
He would then wait for 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 more days to start lifting heavy again
That means he needs to wait 18+21=<<18+21=39>>39 days
#### 39
Completion:
<think> 3 days after the injury, the pain subsided, so the injury would take 5 * 3 days = 15 days to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again. So he would wait a total of 15 days + 3 days = 18 days before he started working out again. After that, he wants to wait 3 weeks, which is 3 * 7 days = 21 days to start lifting heavy again. So in total, James would have to wait 18 days + 21 days = 39 days before he can lift heavy again. </think>

Question:
James hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?
Answer:
The injury would be fully healed after 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 days
So he would start exercising again in 15+3=<<15+3=18>>18 days
He would then wait for 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 more days to start lifting heavy again
That means he needs to wait 18+21=<<18+21=39>>39 days

<answer> James wants to wait 3 weeks after he starts exercising before he can lift heavy again. This means he needs to wait 3 weeks x 7 days = 21 days before he can start lifting heavy again. So, 21 days + 3 days = 24 days. Therefore, James can lift heavy again after 24 days.

James' injury would take at least 3 * 5 = 15 days to fully heal.
After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again. So, in total, he would wait 15 + 3 = 18 days.
He wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.
To find out how long until he can lift heavy again, we add the 18 days he has already been waiting to the 21 days he wants to wait. So, the total time until he can lift heavy again is 18 + 21 = 39 days.
The answer is: 39

#### 10
Completion:
To calculate the profit on each orange, we first need to find out the total cost of the oranges and the total revenue from selling them.

Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. So, the cost per orange is $12.50 / 25 = $0.50.

He sells each orange for 60 cents. So, the revenue per orange is 60 cents / 25 = 2.4 cents.

To find the profit per orange, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

Profit per orange = Revenue per orange - Cost per orange
Profit per orange = 2.4 cents - 0.50 cents
Profit per orange = 1.9 cents

So, Joshua will make a profit of 19 cents on each orange.

$1 is equivalent to 100 cents so $12.50 is equivalent to 100*12.50 = <<12.50*100=1250>>1250 cents
He bought 25 oranges for 1250 cents so each orange cost 1250/25 = <<1250/25=50>>50 cents each
If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60-50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cents on each one.
#### 10
Completion:
To find the profit per orange, we first need to calculate the cost price per orange, and then subtract the selling price from the cost price to find the profit. The cost price per orange is the total amount spent on the oranges divided by the number of oranges, while the selling price per orange is the total amount spent on the oranges plus the profit.

Let's start by calculating the cost price per orange:

1. Cost price per orange = Total amount spent on the oranges / Number of oranges
2. Cost price per orange = $12.50 / 25
3. Cost price per orange = $0.50

Next, we calculate the profit per orange:

1. Profit per orange = Selling price per orange - Cost price per orange
2. Profit per orange = $60 - $0.50
3. Profit per orange = $59.50

To convert this profit to cents, we multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):

1. Profit in cents = $59.50 * 100
2. Profit in cents = $5950

Therefore, Joshua will make a profit of 5950 cents on each orange.

Question:
Joshua bought 25 oranges for $12.50. If he sells each one for 60c, how much profit in cents will he make on each orange?
Answer:
$1 is equivalent to 100 cents so $12.50 is equivalent to 100*12.50 = <<12.50*100=1250>>1250 cents
He bought 25 oranges for 1250 cents so each orange cost 1250/25 = <<1250/25=50>>50 cents each
If he sells each orange for 60 cents, he is making a profit of 60-50 = <<60-50=10>>10 cents on each one.
#### 10
Completion:
To calculate the profit on each orange, we need to first determine the cost price of each orange, which is the total cost of the oranges minus the revenue from selling the oranges.

The total cost of the oranges is the cost per orange multiplied by the number of oranges:
Cost per orange = $12.50 / 25 oranges = $0.50/orange

The revenue from selling each orange is the selling price per orange multiplied by the number of oranges:
Revenue per orange = $0.60/orange

To find the profit on each orange, we subtract the cost price from the revenue:
Profit per orange = Revenue per orange - Cost per orange

We can calculate the profit per orange using the formula:
Profit per orange = $0.60 - $0.50 = $0.10

To convert this profit to cents, we multiply by 100:
Profit per orange in cents = $0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

So, Joshua will make a profit of 10 cents on each orange.

Question:
Jason and Jeremy want to paint their wall white and agreed to split the cost of the paint. A gallon of paint costs $45 and can cover up to 400 square feet. How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?
Answer:
They need 1600 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<1600/400=4>>4 gallons of paint for their walls.
Since they will do a second coating, then they would need 4 gallons x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 gallons in all.
Eight gallons of paint will cost $45/gallon x 8 gallons = $<<45*8=360>>360.
Thus, Jason and Jeremy will each contribute $360/2 = $<<360/2=180>>180.
#### 180
Completion:
<think>
The total area of their walls is 1600 square feet, and they will need a second coat. So, they need to cover a total of 1600 x 2 = 3200 square feet.
A gallon of paint can cover up to 400 square feet, so they will need 3200 / 400 = 8 gallons of paint.
Each gallon of paint costs $45, so the total cost of the paint will be 8 x $45 = $360.
Each of them will contribute $360 / 2 = $180 to the cost of the paint.
The answer is: $180.

To calculate how much each person will contribute to the cost of the paint, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted.
2. Calculate the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the paint.
4. Divide the total cost by the number of gallons to find out how much each person will contribute.

Let's start with these steps:

1. Calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted.
2. Calculate the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the paint.
4. Divide the total cost by the number of gallons to find out how much each person will contribute.

First, let's calculate the total square footage that needs to be painted:

Total square footage = Total area of walls * Number of coats
Total square footage = 1600 square feet * 2
Total square footage = 3200 square feet

Now, let's calculate the number of gallons needed:

Number of gallons = Total square footage / Coverage of one gallon
Number of gallons = 3200 square feet / 400 square feet
Number of gallons = 8 gallons

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the paint:

Total cost of paint = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost of paint = 8 gallons * $45 per gallon
Total cost of paint = $360

Finally, let's divide the total cost by the number of gallons to find out how much each person will contribute:

Cost per person = Total cost of paint / Number of gallons
Cost per person = $360 / 8 gallons
Cost per person = $45

So, each person will contribute $45 to the cost of the paint.

Let's calculate the total cost of the paint for both Jason and Jeremy.

1. First, we need to determine the total area of their walls. Since the total area of the walls is 1600 square feet and they need a second coat, the area of one wall is 1600/2 = 800 square feet.

2. Now, we can calculate the number of gallons needed for the entire wall. Since the paint covers 400 square feet per gallon and they will need 800 square feet for both walls, they will need 800/400 = 2 gallons of paint.

3. Next, we calculate the cost of the paint for both Jason and Jeremy. The cost of one gallon of paint is $45, so for 2 gallons, it would be 2 * $45 = $90.

4. Finally, we can calculate how much each of them will contribute to the cost of the paint. Jason will contribute $90, and Jeremy will contribute $90/2 = $45.

The answer is: Jason, $90, Jeremy, $45.

How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?
Answer:
They need 1600 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<1600/400=4>>4 gallons of paint for their walls.
Since they will do a second coating, then they would need 4 gallons x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 gallons in all.
Eight gallons of paint will cost $45/gallon x 8 gallons = $<<45*8=360>>360.
Thus, Jason and Jeremy will each contribute $360/2 = $<<360/2=180>>180.
#### 180
Completion:
<think>
The total cost of the paint is $45 x 2 = $90.
They will need 1600 / 400 = 4 gallon of paint.
So, each of them will contribute 90 / 4 = $22.5.
The answer is 22.5.

Question:
If 100 pieces, each 15 centimeters long, are cut from a 51-meter long ribbon, how much ribbon remains ?
Answer:
The total length cut from the 51-meter ribbon is 100 x 15 centimeters = <<100*15=1500>>1500 centimeters.
Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, then 1500 centimeters is equal to 1500/100 = <<1500/100=15>>15 meters.
Therefore, 51 - 15 = <<51-15=36>>36 meters of ribbon remains.

Answer:
The total length cut from the 51-meter ribbon is 100 x 15 centimeters = <<100*15=1500>>1500 centimeters.
Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, then 1500 centimeters is equal to 1500/100 = <<1500/100=15>>15 meters.
Therefore, 51 - 15 = <<51-15=36>>36 meters of ribbon remains.
#### 36
Completion:
<think> The total length of the ribbon is 51 meters. Each piece is 15 centimeters long, which is 0.15 meters. So, to find the total length of the pieces, we multiply the length of each piece by the number of pieces: 0.15 meters/piece * 100 pieces = 15 meters. Then, we add the length of the 51-meter long ribbon to this total: 51 meters + 15 meters = 66 meters. 
The answer is 66 meters.

#### 36
Completion:
<think> Reasoning process here: The total length of the ribbon is 51 meters, and each piece is 15 centimeters long. To find out how many pieces can be cut from the 51-meter long ribbon, we divide the total length by the length of each piece. So, 51 meters / 15 centimeters = 3.4 meters. Since we can't cut a piece in half, we'll have to cut 4 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 4 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 60 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 60 centimeters = 45 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 9 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 5 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 5 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces. So, the total length of the pieces is 3 pieces * 15 centimeters per piece = 45 centimeters. The length of the remaining ribbon after cutting the pieces is 51 meters - 45 centimeters = 6 centimeters. Since we can't cut a centimeter in half, we'll have to cut 3 pieces.

<answer>5 bottles of wine will cost 5 * $20.00 = $100.00 more today. The new tariff will increase the price by 25%, so the new price will be $20.00 + $100.00 * 0.25 = $25.00. 5 bottles of wine will therefore be $25.00 * 5 = $125.00 more expensive in 2 months.

Question:
A bottle of wine costs $20.00 today.  When new tariffs are imposed in 2 months, the price of wine will increase by 25%.  How much more expensive will 5 bottles of wine be in 2 months?
Answer:
Today, 5 bottles of $20.00 wine will cost 5*20 = $<<5*20=100.00>>100.00
In 2 months there will be a 25% tariff on the 5 bottles of wine that cost $100.00 so that makes the 5 bottles .25*100 = $25.00 more expensive

<think> The price of wine will increase by 25% in 2 months. So, the price of wine will increase by 20 * 0.25 = $5.00. The original price of 5 bottles of wine is 5 * $20.00 = $100.00. The new price of 5 bottles of wine will be 5 * $20.00 + $5.00 = $105.00. The difference in cost will be $105.00 - $100.00 = $5.00. The answer is 5.00.

Question:
Timmy plans to ride a skateboard ramp that is 50 feet high. He knows he needs to go 40 mph at the start to make it all the way to the top. He measures his speed on three trial runs and goes 36, 34, and 38 mph. How much faster does he have to go than his average speed to make it up the ramp?
Answer:
His total speed from the trials is 108 because 36 + 34 + 38 = <<36+34+38=108>>108
His average speed was 36 mph because 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36

<think> Reasoning process: Timmy needs to go 40 mph at the start to make it all the way to the top of the ramp. He has three trial runs and averaged 36 + 34 + 38 = 108 mph. To make it up the ramp, he needs to go 40 - 108 = -68 mph faster. However, since speed is always a positive number, we need to find the absolute difference between the average speed and the required speed. The absolute difference is |-68| = 68 mph. Therefore, Timmy needs to go 68 mph faster than his average speed to make it up the ramp. </think>

The space station, Lupus-1, is an enormous spacecraft made up of three identical cylindrical structures that house the living quarters for the crew.   The three cylindrical structures are linked together by a series of tunnels that hold them together and allow the crew to move between cylinders.  Each cylindrical structure contains 12 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and several kitchens.  If the entire space station has 72 rooms, how many kitchens are there on the entire space station?
Answer:
If there are 3 identical cylindrical structures, with a combined total of 72 rooms, then each individual cylindrical structure contains 72/3=<<72/3=24>>24 rooms.
In each 24-room cylindrical structure, there are 24-12-7=<<24-12-7=5>>5 kitchens.
Thus, the entire, three-cylinder space station contains a total of 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 kitchens.
#### 15
Completion:
To find out how many kitchens there are on the entire space station, we need to subtract the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens from the total number of rooms. Let's do the math:

- The number of bedrooms is 12 rooms.
- The number of bathrooms is 7 rooms.
- The number of kitchens is 72 rooms - 12 rooms - 7 rooms.

Now, let's calculate the number of kitchens:

- Number of kitchens = Total rooms - (Number of bedrooms + Number of bathrooms + Number of kitchens)
- Number of kitchens = 72 - (12 + 7 + 7)

Let's do the math:

- Number of kitchens = 72 - (19 + 7)
- Number of kitchens = 72 - 26
- Number of kitchens = 46

So, there are 46 kitchens on the entire space station.

#### 15
Completion:
To find the number of kitchens on the entire space station, we can first determine the total number of bedrooms and bathrooms in the space station, and then subtract that from the total number of rooms to get the number of kitchens.

Total number of bedrooms and bathrooms = 12 bedrooms + 7 bathrooms = 19 rooms
Total number of rooms = 72 rooms

Number of kitchens = Total number of rooms - Total number of bedrooms and bathrooms = 72 rooms - 19 rooms = 53 kitchens
The number of kitchens on the entire space station is 53.
